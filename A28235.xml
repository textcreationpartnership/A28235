         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A LOOKING-GLASS FOR THE TIMES. BEING A Tract concerning the Original and Riſe of Truth, and the Original and Riſe of Antichriſt. SHEWING By pregnant inſtances of Scripture, Hiſtory, and other Writings, That the Principles and Practices of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> in this day, and their Sufferings, are the ſame as were the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that, and of the Holy Men of God ſince, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus, who have Propheſied in Sackcloth: And that the Apoſtacy hath held all other Profeſſions ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles. In a conſtant Series out of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, by way of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, for near the firſt 600. years, and other Fathers (ſo accounted) and learned Men both of the former Day, and This. That Men may once ſee, and be adviſed in the words of the Principles of their own Profeſſions, and of others whom they eſteem. That the Truth held and practiſed by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> is no other than what themſelves, or ſuch as they approve of, have held forth in Word, or have practiſed.

            <p>THE Everlaſting God, which ſetteth the bounds to the Nations, and declareth to man his thoughts, is not circumſcribed to time or place; but in every Nation, he that feareth God, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him: This ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> of old, who once thought (as did the <hi>Samaritans)</hi> that all Religion was impaled to the Jews, who had the Circumciſion, to whom pertained the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> whoſe were the Fathers, and of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Therefore he, thought it much, in the <hi>Viſion</hi> that was ſhewen him, to<hi>—Ariſe, ſlay and eat,—Not ſo Lord,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for I</hi>

               <hi>have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</hi> But, ſaid the <hi>Voice</hi> the ſecond time,<hi>—What God hath cleanſed, that call not thou common,</hi> in the Caſe of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> unto whom he was ſent, being a <hi>Gentile,</hi> to turn unto the <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſaid Chriſt Jeſus to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worſhipped in this Mountain; and ye ſay, That in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is the place where men ought to worſhip.</hi> Woman, <hi>believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>worſhip the Father. Ye worſhip ye know not what; We know what we worſhip, for Salvation is of the Jews; But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And ſaid the Apoſtle,<hi>—Who hath alſo made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life: but if the miniſtration of the Letter, written and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in ſtones, was glorious; ſo that the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of</hi> Moſes, <hi>for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away; How ſhall not the miniſtration of the Spirit be rather glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? for if the miniſtration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the miniſtration of Righteouſneſs exceed in glory: for even that which was made glorious, had no glory, in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth; for if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6, to the 12.</p>
            <p>The intent and ſubſtance of all which, is as much as to ſay, That there is no Religion under the Sun, or no preſcription that ought to be, as to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100654:4"/> any thing that relates to the Worſhip of God, or that is ground of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſince Chriſt came in the fleſh, and was offered up, but what is within, in Spirit and in Truth; which is in oppoſition to all outward Forms, which proceed not from the Spirit.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, during the State under which they ſtood, of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> had no further reference than to themſelves, who had the Circumciſion, or outward Adminiſtration, the <hi>Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances,</hi> which Law was <hi>added becauſe of tranſgreſſion till the Seed ſhould come,</hi> which is Chriſt, who being come, put an end to Circumciſion, and that outward Adminiſtration, which with the Jew ended, who was of the Stock of <hi>Sem,</hi> which related not to the <hi>Gentile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that whole Adminiſtration, with the particularity of the <hi>Jew</hi> in the fleſh, had an end, and hath no more ground of enforcement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be obliged to a form, or that form of Worſhip, or outward Adminiſtration, then if the <hi>Jew</hi> in the fleſh had not been, or that outward Adminiſtration, for it related to time and perſons, and not to the body of the World, or the univerſality of dayes; which time being out, or expired, and thoſe perſons or Nations at an end, as to that for which they were taken into a particular conſideration, the thing hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an end with them, and cannot admit of a force upon themſelves, or thoſe that are yet left of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; much leſs upon thoſe who are not <hi>Jews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom the Lord never ſo took in, nor dealt with, as to any outward Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>So that to enforce, or to endeavour ſo to do, from what was once the Adminiſtration of God in the fleſh to the <hi>Jews,</hi> on them who are not <hi>Jews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what the Scriptures hold forth to be the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to ſeek to ground from thence a bottom, why all Nations, or the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be in an outward adminiſtration of Worſhip, and ſhould be bounded in, or denominated by any particular form, is to put force upon the Scriptures, and to hold forth that which neither doth the Scripture, nor is the intent of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and which Chriſt Jeſus ended in the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the Apoſtles teſtified unto, ſo to be ended, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt place; Where there is no ground or bottom for ſuch a thing, no ſuch thing from ſuch a thing can be concluded: But no ſuch bottom or ground is there for any ſuch thing, as from the <hi>Judaical</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to enforce a legal Adminiſtration, or outward form of Worſhip, as hath been declared, ſince Chriſt was offered up, and an end put thereby to that Adminiſtration. Therefore to enforce any ſuch thing now, that he is offered up, and that Adminiſtration ended, is to enforce ſuch a thing without a ground or bottom.</p>
            <p>In the next place; The Lord Jeſus when he was offered up, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, gave gifts unto men, (not outward Adminiſtrations, as to Times, Places, and Nations,) <hi>Some Evangeliſts,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors, ſome Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Adminiſtration of the Spirit, or of Righteouſneſs, is that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100654:4"/> which excels in glory, (as hath been ſaid); and even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All outward Adminiſtrations had a time to end as well as to begin, and they had a ſignification, which the thing ſignified being come, vaniſhed, and came to nothing; So all that which was the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Jews,</hi> had its beginning and end, its time to come to nothing, and to vaniſh, as it had to begin; which was when the thing ſignified, the end and intent of that Adminiſtration, was come, which was Chriſt; the morning being come, the ſhadows fly away; that which was before tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion being come, that comes to be removed which was added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Spirit it was, that led the Diſciples into all Truth; not the Letter, for that kills, as the Apoſtle ſaith, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And the Worſhip which Chriſt, who was the end of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſet up for all to walk by, whether <hi>Samaritan,</hi> or the Inhabitant of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, bond</hi> or <hi>free, Barbarian</hi> or <hi>Scythian, Male</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> the publick Worſhip which he would have all to be exerciſed in, and which he ſaith, <hi>The Father chuſes to worſhip him;</hi> the true VVorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which are not at this Mountain, nor at Jeruſalem, that in which he ſaid the <hi>true Worſhippers ſhould worſhip;</hi> and that the time was to come, or cometh, <hi>Yea, it now is,</hi> (ſaith he) Is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> John 4. as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>So that the Glory that excelleth, the Adminiſtration of the Spirit which exceeds in Glory, the Spirit which gives Life; the Gift, not the outward Adminiſtration; the thing that is come, not that which is done away; the ſubſtance, not the ſhadow; the Inſtitution of the Son, <hi>which abides in the Houſe for ever,</hi> not the Adminiſtration of the Servant, which is not to abide in the Houſe for ever; the univerſality, or largeneſs, where the partitian Wall is taken down, not the particularity, or narrowneſs, where the partitian Wall ſtandeth, is that which in this day, ſince Chriſt was offered up, and aſcended, is to be looked to and heeded, as that which is pleaſing to the Lord, and which he accepts.</p>
            <p>For I would demand, Wherein, or upon what bottom can any ground a contrary Aſſertion? Is Chriſt come, or not? Is he offered up, or not? Is he aſcended, or not? Fills he all things, or not? If he be ſo, why then is that enforced or ſought ſo to be, or placed, which was before he came, which was to end in him? Either he is come, or he is not come; if he is not come, then let ſuch ſay ſo in open words, who do the things that were to be, or had their being before he came; if he be come, how dare any to enforce that, or ſeek ſo to do, which was before he came, or that which by his coming is done away?</p>
            <p>The Matter is brought, or lies in a narrow compaſs, and there is no trifling in the Matter; the things are of the higheſt conſequence, and mortals muſt take heed of giving Law to their Maker; and the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherds of the Earth muſt beware of claſhing againſt him that formed them; and they who are in the condition or ſtate of deſtruction, muſt heed how they aſcend, or ſeek ſo to do, in his Throne who lives for ever, who came to redeem, on whoſe ſhoulders the Government lies, who is the <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace, Wonderful, Counſellor,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of his <hi>Church, King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> who only hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100654:5"/> Immortality and eternal Life; to whom be Glory, and Power, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Away then with all outſide Religion, (that is to ſay) all that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from Spirit and Truth; away with all Forms that come not from the power of Godlineſs; away with all <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Forms, Conſtitutions, Canons, Orders, Decrees, Directories, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms, Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> all forcing of Religion, all perſecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Religion, all Injunctions, <hi>Synods, Councils, Preſcriptions, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> all outward, fleſhly, carnal Commandments, <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> all imitations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and doing things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them, or becauſe of what they did, or were led into, where the ſame Spirit of Jeſus is not the Leader, as it was in them, is not the ground and bottom, root and ſource, as it was theirs. Away with all private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and Worſhips, and Precepts of Men; all National Worſhips, and Religions; all forcings ſuch Religions and Worſhips; Chriſt the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is come; Chriſt the true <hi>Jew</hi> inwardly is come; Chriſt the <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>National Worſhip</hi> had its inſtitution under the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Jewiſh was the only Nation which the Scriptures mention to have had a Worſhip that was <hi>National</hi> ordained of God, who as a Figure or Repreſentation of what was to be Univerſal, in reference to thoſe throughout the World, whom the Lord would gather to be Kings and Prieſts unto God, a Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>This Nation of the Jews had their Laws and Ordinances, their Kings and Governors, their Religion and Worſhip all outward, though they had their inward ſignification, which was Chriſt, the Meſſiah, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which was to come, who according to the fleſh, was of theirs who were of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Seed in the Spirit, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are the Elect, the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom to redeem he came in the fleſh; ſo the whole conſtitution of the Jewiſh Kingdom, whether as to the Civil Policy, or Eccleſiaſtical, had its face looking hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, which it ſignified, which it repreſented.</p>
            <p>Now in the fulneſs of time, he coming, whom theſe things did hold forth, and typifie, and which in his fleſh, the laſt of all was accompliſhed, the things themſelves ceaſed, and he whiles he was not yet offered up, and all things yet were not accompliſhed, began to end them, as the

               <hi>inward part;</hi> the Seed, which is Chriſt, the High Prieſt of his People, was added, or given, which was not at firſt, to wit, the <hi>Law written in Tables of Stone;</hi> but, in the fleſhly Table of the Heart, and which was promiſed ſhould be again, and which now came to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>So the Partition-Wall came to be removed, and that which was general to the Jews in the Figure, who were ſingled from all the Nations in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, came to be general to the Jew in the Spirit throughout all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to be no more particular to the Jew; and this was that which <hi>Peter</hi> aforeſaid came to be informed of, when in the Viſion he was ſent to the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and which made him ſpeak, having been ſo informed, as aforeſaid; <hi>I perceive, of a truth, that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the thing being come, Chriſt Jeſus, the Univerſal Head of the Church, which the Prieſthood ſignified to the Nation of the Jews, the Partition, (that is to ſay) the Nation of the Jews, or the Laws, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Adminiſtrations of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were outward, came to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the Vail to be rent, and no more was the National Church-Worſhip to be minded, which that conſtitution held forth, but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which was to be Univerſal: Now through the offering of him up, and the Law in the Heart, and the fear in the inward parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt the Seed, was that which every one was to know, and worſhip by, as it was in the beginning before tranſgreſſion was, and as before the Law was given by the Prophets, and holy men of God, <hi>Abraham</hi> (who <hi>ſaw his day and rejoyced; who ſaid, Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am) Noah, Enoch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it came to paſs, that upon the firſt encounter, when after he was riſen from the dead and aſcended, and the Holy Ghoſt was given, the Comforter, which he ſaid he would ſend to them, which ſhould abide with them for ever, the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he ſaid, ſhould receive of his, and give unto them the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or rather Narrowneſs, was no longer to the Nation of the Jews, but its extent was to the end of the World; <hi>How hear we every man in his own tongue wherein he was born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and dwellers in Meſopotamia, and in Judea, and in Cappadocia, in Pontus and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Phrygia and Pamphilia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Lybia, about Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, and ſtrangers of Rome, Jews and Proſelytes, Creets and Arabians; We do hear them ſpeak in our tongues the wonderful Works of God: And there were added the ſame day unto them about three thouſand Souls. Peter,</hi> a Jew
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100654:6"/> according to the fleſh, preaching to them who were <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> now promiſcuouſly together; and to the <hi>Gentiles, The promiſe is to you, and to your Children, and to thoſe that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Acts 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 39, 41.</p>
            <p>So that the limits of the Church was now no longer reſtrained to the People or Nation of the Jews, nor the Worſhip, but to all Nations of the Earth, to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Church of God amongſt them, which to gather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to draw into one, was the Goſpel ſent and preached; and the Worſhip now was no longer National, nor was it the National Worſhip of the Jews, which alſo was commanded of God, and accompanied with his preſence, while the end of it was not come, or accompliſhed; But it was every where, Spirit and Truth, not Form and Letter, fearing of God, working of Righteouſneſs is accepted of him; the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, the Worſhippers whom the Father ſeeks to worſhip him: All the others were daſht in pieces, the end was accompliſhed, it ſtood not in meats and drinks, the Kingdom of God, but in <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> not in killing of Sheep, and ſlaying of Oxen, but in an humble and contrite heart, and that trembled at his Word, the Sacrifices of God which even under the Law were entitled, and ſaid to be his, through all which he looked for, and accepted; which the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the blood of Goats and Bulls ſignified; Circumciſion, and all the Ordinances of the Jews, which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded, and which it was death not to obſerve, comes now to be called <hi>beggerly Rudiments,</hi> the <hi>Hand-writing</hi> of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Commandments</hi> contained in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> the enmity which he deſtroyed on the Croſs, and blotted out, which the Apoſtle ſaith, was <hi>againſt them,</hi> and which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear; And he ſaith, <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtles now, as any were gathered into the Church, they gathered them out of all the Jewiſh Obſervations, and Heatheniſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols, into one God, and Name of the Lord Jeſus, who was the great Shepherd and Biſhop of the Soul; Not into the Name of the Church of the Jews, or the Temple, or of this Region and that, but into the Name of Chriſt Jeſus; The Churches of what?

            <p>And ſo it was during the Apoſtles times, of which the Scripture makes mention, and their buſineſs was to open the eyes, to turn men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among <hi>them which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Faith, which is in me;</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of his Commiſſion which he received of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.

               <hi>Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Chriſt down from above) Or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead.) But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is the Word of Faith which we preach,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>But finding fault with them,</hi> (that is, the firſt Covenant, and the things therein, of which he had been ſpeaking in the former words) he ſaith, <hi>Behold, the dayes come (ſaith the Lord) when I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> Judah: <hi>Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>becauſe they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord: For this is the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People; And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt unto the greateſt; For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Now here is nothing of Churchſhip, of an outward Adminiſtration and Worſhip, of a delegation of Power to any to conſtitute and appoint Worſhips, or how God ſhould be worſhipped, or what Diſcipline ſhould be uſed in the Church, or what Power the Church ſhould have, as to viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and who ſhould be the Governors or Rulers thereof, that ſhould direct or order, as to that throughout all Ages; but a turning to a Principle, wherein God is to be known, and whereby he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; Not to <hi>Man, Kings, Princes, Governors, States, Emperors;</hi> no not to <hi>Presbyters, Councils, Fathers, Paſtors, Officers, Synods: Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi>

            <p>The Lord never ſent to turn man unto man, nor did he ever give power to man to order man, as to the Worſhips of him, no not in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Adminiſtration; all the World have been in miſtakes about theſe things; but he alwayes reſerved the power in himſelf; and by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and order of him, man was to be directed, and God to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; for from the Lord <hi>Moſes</hi> received in the <hi>mount</hi> what was that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; &amp; hitherto, to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were gone aſtray, and had tranſgreſſed, were all things to be reduced, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be made, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a figure of that which came by Jeſus Chriſt, unto which all things after he was come, to which <hi>Moſes</hi> his Adminiſtration, or the Law which was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to have reference, as it was to ſpring from it; And the coming of him was the time of Reformation of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Heb. 9. 10. <hi>Which ſtood</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of that Miniſtration which in the verſe before he calls a <hi>Figure) only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, or the duration of the ſtanding of the Law, or the outward Adminiſtration, or Jewiſh National Worſhip, was not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for ever, the firſt Covenant, but it was to paſs away, and to have an end, as <hi>not being able to make the comers thereunto perfect,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. though it was commanded of the Lord: So there was to be a time of Reformation, when that which could not make the comers thereunto perfect, was to be removed; when that which was the <hi>ſhadow of good things to come, but not the very Image of the things,</hi> (as the ſame place hath it) was to have an end, which was in the coming of him who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, who perfects for <hi>ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. which the other lead unto; <hi>For by one Offering</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in the verſe aforeſaid) <hi>he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi> and this was called the time of <hi>Reformation,</hi> when he came who put an end to all that was outward, and had a viſible, or an outward Adminiſtration, which could not make the comers thereunto perfect, nor was appointed for that end and purpoſe, but to lead unto another thing which ſhould put an end thereunto, and which was its end.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, if the very outward Moſaical Jewiſh Adminiſtration, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Worſhip, the firſt Covenant, which was all the outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was commanded of God in the World, was not of man, but from the Lord; which yet had reference to another thing, which was Chriſt, the new Covenant, the Law put into the mind, and wrote in the heart, which was the Prophet, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the Jews, the <hi>Lord their God ſhould raiſe unto them of their Brethren like unto him, whom they ſhould hear in all things, whatſoever he ſhould ſay unto them; and that it ſhould come to paſs that every Soul</hi> (he doth not ſay Body) <hi>that will not hear that Prophet, ſhould be deſtroyed from among the people,</hi> Acts 2. 23. How much more now that the thing is come, which thoſe Adminiſtrations had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto, (the great Reformer) ought all things now in relation unto Worſhip have reference unto him; and how ought all things of this nature thither to be directed?</p>
            <p>For, as I ſaid, he ſent not to turn from man to man, from the darkneſs to man, but to the Light, to the Principle of God, that which is of God in man, the Seed, which is Chriſt, the <hi>Myſtery hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations now made manifeſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26, 27. that men may know who they worſhip, and when, and how thy may worſhip him; <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth: Spirit,</hi> that is, ſomething that is Spirit, that is of the Nature that <hi>God</hi> is, that is Spirit and Truth, that is as as he is, Spirit; they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him not in the Letter, not in the Injunctions of men, not in an outward or fleſhly Principle; not in man, or the ſpirit of man, but of God, which is in oppoſition to all that is of man, or cometh from man, that is not from the Spirit or Principle of God.</p>
            <p>So men muſt firſt come to learn, or be turned to the Light, to the Principle of God, to that which is Spirit, by which they may come to know him that dwells in the Light that is inacceſſible, as to all that is manniſh or mortal from the darkneſs, all that is from man, or of him, who is mortal; then ſomething may be ſaid to them as to the Worſhip
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100654:8"/> of God; then they are ſomewhere, and know ſomething which God accepts, and in which he is well pleaſed; <hi>ſuch Worſhippers the Father ſeeks to worſhip him:</hi> All other Worſhips are not available, nor are they to any purpoſe, nor doth God ſeek them, though men may think thereby that they ſeek after God: The time of Reformation ſvveeps them avvay to the Moles and to the Bats, to go into the Clefts of the Rocks, all the Idols of Silver and of Gold, <hi>which are made each one for himſelf to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and into the tops of the ragged Rocks, for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth.

               <hi>that thou mayeſt do it,</hi> Deut. 30. 13, 14. <hi>The Word is nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the Word of Faith which we Preach,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. there is no need of going afar off. As he hath made man individual, ſo he requires every individual man to worſhip him; and he hath put ſomething of himſelf, a meaſure of Chriſt Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every individual man, whereby and wherein every individual man may worſhip him: this is General, this is Univerſal, this is Publick, this is Catholick; he hath not left man to ſeek out of himſelf, to form, to ſhape, to liken, nor to depend one man upon another, how or wherein he ſhould be worſhipped; he hath not put him to that hazard, neither hath laid upon him that which is a heavy burden, or too hard for him to bear, or at too great a diſtance, or at any diſtance at all; but as he hath required man, ſo he is near man, or he hath put into man that which will enable him to do as he requires. So the Lord is no hard Maſter, nor doth require impoſſibilities; nor hath he left man to wander up and down, but he is near him to take him by the hand, and to lead him to all that he requires; he is in him to tell him what he ſhould do, and he is with him to enable him to do what he would have him; the ſame that doth the one, doth the other: Herein is the loving kindneſs of God ſeen, and his juſtice, that he requires no more than he enables to do, and that he gives to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do what he requires; and to another man hath not the Lord left man to be directed, but the thing is in himſelf, which all the World is mad at, becauſe the Devil is in all the World; and he would perſwade man that God is afar from him, as the Devil is to God, and gets his eye abroad to look at a diſtance where God is not to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is to be known of God, is manifeſt in man, for God hath ſhewn it unto him;</hi> but the work of the one my hath been to draw man from this; <hi>The inviſible things of him are clearly ſeen from the Creation of the World, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19, 20. <hi>Yet becauſe that when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned; profeſſing themſelves wiſe, they became fools, and changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an Image made like corruptible man, and to Birds and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping things; wherefore God alſo gave them up to uncleanneſs, through the luſts of their own hearts, to diſhonour their own bodies between themſelves, who changed the Truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator, who is God bleſſed for ever, Amen. For this cauſe God gave them up to vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for even their Women did change their natural uſe into that which is againſt Nature; and likewiſe alſo the men leaving the natural uſe of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, burned in their luſt one towards another, men with men working that which is unſeemly, and receiving in themſelves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things that are not convenient,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 21, to the end.</p>
            <p>So here's the reaſon why men are ſo far off God, and are ſtrangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and become abominable, and to every good work reprobate; it is not that God is not near them, or that that of God which is to be known is not manifeſt in them, even his eternal Power and Godhead;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100654:9"/> but becauſe they like not to retain him in their knowledge, becauſe when they know God, they glorifie him not as God, neither are thankful, but become vain in their imaginations; ſo they come to change the Glory of the incorruptible God into an Image like unto corruptible man; men come to form God like unto themſelves, and make him like as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to be, therefore God gives them up, who change the Truth of God into a lie, into imaginations of things without them, their fooliſh heart being darkned, and to worſhip the Creature more than the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Here's the reaſon of all the falſe Worſhip in the World, all worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God at a diſtance, all inventions of men, and their medling and having to do with Worſhip, and to order that, all outward Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Perſecution for not obſerving the ſame. Men are gone far from God, their fooliſh heart is darkned, they are become vain in their imaginations, they are alienated from God by wicked works, they have not liked to retain God in their knowledge, nor have been thankful, that that of God which is to be known was manifeſt [in] them; therefore have they put God afar off, and looked upon him at a diſtance; and ſo have made Images and Repreſentations, and taken upon them to form him as they pleaſe, and a Worſhip for him as they pleaſe; and they that will not fall down to it, into the fiery Furnace they muſt be thrown, and into the Lyons Den he muſt be caſt, that will make a Petition to any other Godd, that will not worſhip God after that manner of Worſhip, and as thoſe their Laws have preſcribed: <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are gone from that which is of him in them, by which they might know him that they have not liked to retain in their knowledge, nor glorified God as God when they knew God, will not own that which is to be known of God, which is manifeſted in them, as it is; then they think of God without them, as he is not, then they frame Worſhips according to their own minds, after this manner, and after that, ſhaping God as they pleaſe, and a Worſhip for him whom they have ſo ſhaped, who have <hi>neither heard his Voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape outwardly;</hi> then they compel all to ſerve this God ſo ſhapen, and to worſhip him as they have ſhaped and formed his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſome after this manner, ſome after that, and thoſe that will not, Fines, Impriſonments, Suſpenſions from Places and Dignities, caſting out, and Excommunications, Whippings, loſing of Ears, burnings in the Body, ſelling for Bond-men and Bond-women, Baniſhment upon pain of Death, and Death it ſelf; after the moſt exquiſite and various manners that can be thought of, as Ages and Generations have proved; of which I am by and by to ſpeak and give witneſs.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon hath bin, becauſe being gone from that of <hi>God</hi> in them, by and in which they ſhould vvorſhip him, and every one in their ovvn particulars, vvhich is near, vvhoſe Injunction as it is in Spirit, ſo is the Worſhip, and the Puniſhment of not ſo vvorſhiping: they are in nothing but vvhat is outvvard themſelves, and knovv no more of God than vvhat themſelves think, which being indeed nothing at all (that is, ſo far, and as they are gone from that, or worſhip or compel thereunto, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than that) their Worſhip is like their Godd, which is as themſelves; <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence: Thou thoughteſt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>before thine eyes. Now conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver,</hi> (Pſal. 50. 21, 22.) and being as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their puniſhment is as themſelves, which is outward, corporeal, as man is not in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>So every one that makes a Worſhip, makes a Godd; and every one that worſhips not God in Spirit and in Truth, makes a Worſhip; and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded be all they that ſerve graven Images, that boaſt themſelves of Idols; worſhip him all ye Godds,</hi> Pſal. 97. 7.</p>
            <p>And the Enemy is in all this, who (as I have ſaid) being far from God himſelf, endeavours to put man as far as himſelf; he removes him from having reſpect to, and minding that of God in him, to look afar off, well knowing that if he can but once do that, he ſhall never know God; and then he can eaſily perſwade man to be as God, and to give Laws how he, indeed as God, may be worſhipped, and to torture and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Bodies of thoſe who worſhip God as he will be worſhipped, or who cannot worſhip God as man would have him worſhipped.</p>
            <p>For he that would drive a man from the Meaſure of God in himſelf, to worſhip God as he pleaſeth, drives a man from God, and inſtead of God ſets himſelf up to be worſhipped, and himſelf being ſet up, or he having ſet up himſelf to be worſhipped, he takes revenge, and puniſhes thoſe who will not worſhip what himſelf ſets up, and ſo falls into the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and of all thoſe, who becauſe of Worſhips, not conforming to their Laws of Worſhip, have cauſed men to ſuffer, as the Hiſtories now to be made mention of give inſtance.</p>

            <p>This was the ground of all the moſt cruel and Heatheniſh perſecutions of the Chriſtians, and of the then called Chriſtians one of another, of which he (and the aforementioned) treat; they knew not Chriſt the Light, which (he ſaith) went (or was) before the World, and all Worlds, the Intellectual and Eſſential Wiſdom, <hi>and the living Word of God, who was in the beginning with the Father;</hi> therefore they thought him a thing (or ſome Impoſter) in time, about that time, or but then brought forth, or appearing, or known in the World, when thoſe who pretended to him were nicknamed, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (that is to ſay) in ſuch a year of the Reign of ſuch a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who is <hi>without beginning of dayes, or end of Life,</hi> as hath been declared: Alſo they who were called Chriſtians, and yet perſecuted one another, were from the Light, Chriſt the Light, which was before the World, and (ſo far, or whilſt as ſuch (that is to ſay) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting one another) knew not that, or were not in it, which was before the World; So they placed things in time, the Heathen, their gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him whoſe Name was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that which one, called <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> perſecuted another for before that, for holding of which, or not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Perſecution of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> one, called Chriſtian, perſecuted another.</p>

            <p>So I have given the ground or occaſion (as to men) how the fame of Jeſus had its liberty to go through the World; which (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath obſerved) no doubt was through the Wiſdom of God, and his mighty Hand, that the report, of what he was and did, from <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſhould bear that weight with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as to allow a propagation thereof throughout his Dominions, which extended very far, by reaſon of which it ſo came to paſs, that multitudes were turned from their Idols, and worſhipped the God which made Heaven and Earth, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus got the Name <hi>Chriſtian</hi> footing in the World, and ſpread it ſelf <note place="margin">Which ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf over</note> under the whole Heaven, as it were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, into Towns, Cities, Nations, Provinces; and the Lord was called upon, who made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and the dry Land, of which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks,

            <p>So the ſetting up of Religion by man, the requiring of man to obſerve the Religion that was ſet up by man, was that which (at firſt) gave the occaſion, or was the ground of the firſt and the fierceſt perſecutions: <note place="margin">And of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, &amp; the ground of it.</note> for (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath fully and well ſaid as aforeſaid) <hi>unleſs that God pleaſe man, he is not made God.—</hi>A ſtrange preſumption, that poor man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, and is not ſure that once more he ſhall breath, ſhould be ſo bewitched with the inchantments of the wicked One, and ſo deluded, as to take upon him to preſcribe unto God, and in effect to ſay unto him who made him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be, or have any</hi>

If he hath made the World and Man, and required Man to worſhip him, and to do what is pleaſing in his ſight; knows not he how to direct man in what manner to worſhip him? Or hath he left man ſo without ſomething of himſelf to guide and inſtruct him, that man muſt needs take upon him to adviſe and inſtruct, yea to inforce, as to the Worſhip of God? <hi>Gird up now thy loyns like a man, for I will demand of thee, and anſwer thou me,</hi> ſaid the Lord to <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 40. verſ. 7. who anſwered, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye doth ſee thee: wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and</hi>

            <p>Well, theſe things coſt them hard who ran this courſe, through <note place="margin">And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof, as to puniſhment, throughout all Generations, as a warning to this.</note> all Generations; and this will coſt them hard who run the ſame courſe now; the Lord will be known by the Judgements that he will execute.

            <p>So all Kings and Princes, Lords and Potentates of the Earth, had need to look about them, and conſider how they meddle with his Dominion, who lives for ever, in the Conſcience, as to his Worſhip; How they ſay in effect, Unleſs he pleaſe them, he ſhall not be made God; and ſo by their Decrees ſpeak that they muſt be gracious and favourable to God, as the Heathens did of old, leſt he daſh them to pieces. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way, if his anger be kindled, yea, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 2. 12.</p>

And thus ſtands it with all thoſe who tread the ſame ſteps; the ſpirit is the ſame, and the way is the ſame, and the work is the ſame, and the ſame will be the end of thoſe that tread therein.</p>

            <p>Great calamities attended the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whilſt their rage was <note place="margin">The ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of them.</note> great againſt the Chriſtians, whilſt they impoſed the Worſhip of their Heathen Godds, and deſtroyed all thoſe who could not bow down unto, nor worſhip them; which when they forbore, and left to theſe who worſhipped the Lord, to worſhip him according to his Spirit, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Law, it flouriſhed, was ſafe, and increaſed. I ſhould be marvellous large if I ſhould go through thoſe things alſo in particular. The rebellious invaſions, diviſions amongſt themſelves, Plagues, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, Famines, Earth-quakes, and untimely deaths that befel thoſe Emperors themſelves, the Lord, when he ſaw time, cutting ſhort their race, who <hi>ordaineth his Arrows againſt the Perſecutor;</hi> notwithſtanding that he ſaw it good alſo to ſuffer thoſe things to be, to prevent greater <note place="margin">The end of the Lord to the Chriſtians in ſuffering theſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</note> miſchiefs amongſt the Chriſtians, and to give teſtimony before all the World of his Power, that was in them wonderfully to carry them through whatſoever was laid upon them for the teſtimony unto his Name. For the Chriſtians, when a little eaſe and liberty befel them, and the Hand of the Lord ſo wrought, that inſtead of being caſt out like Dogs, and cut off every way with the moſt cruel and deteſtable ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and trampled under foot as if they were not fit to live among men, or as Beaſts of prey were made to be deſtroyed, they were accounted eminent and honourable, and had to doing in the mannagement of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, and in the very Emperors Pallaces were the men of account and truſt; they degenerated from the natural Rule of Piety, (as are the Hiſtorians own words, and his honeſt and right obſervation); and after <note place="margin">The Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans account of the cauſe, as among the Chriſtians of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that one purſued another with open contumely and hatred, (as he goes on and ſpeaks) and when (ſaith he) we impugned our ſelves by no other than our ſelves with the Armour ſpite, and ſharp Spears of oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious words, ſo that Biſhops againſt Biſhops, and People againſt People raiſed Sedition.

That you neither object at all, neither anſwer any Objection that concerneth ſuch matters; for ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as no Law or Eccleſiaſtical Canon neceſſarily defineth, but the fruitleſs contention of idle brains ſetteth abroad, though the exerciſe thereof avail for the ſharpning of the wit, yet ought we to retain them in the inward Cloſet of our mind, and not raſhly to broach them in the publick Aſſembly of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people, neither unadviſedly to grant the common ſort the hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for how many be there that can worthily explicate, and ſufficiently pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of ſo grave, ſo intricate, ſo obſcure a matter? But if there be any ſuch that perſwadeth himſelf eaſily to compaſs and attain unto it, how many parts are there, I beſeech you, of the multitude whom he can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtruct therein? And who is there, who in ſifting out ſo curious a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that can well paſs the peril of plunging into error? Wherefore in ſuch caſes we muſt refrain from verbal diſputations, leſt that either we, by reaſon of the imbecility of our Wit cannot explicate our mind, either our Auditors, when we teach, by reaſon of their dull capacity cannot comprehend the curious drift of our Doctrine, whereby the people of neceſſity, either incurreth the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either of blaſphemy, or the poyſoned infection of diſcord, wherefore both the raſh Objection, and the unadviſed anſwer, being the cauſe of the heretical Sect of the</hi> Arrians, Eunomians, <hi>and as many as favour the like folly, ought each one of each other crave pardon.</hi>

            <p>This I ſay was the cauſe of the diviſion, and in at this door entred the enemy to make ſhipwrack of the Flock, as by and by I ſhall make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, though the Emperor ſeems to be of another mind in his Letter aforeſaid, wherein he ſaith further,<hi>—Neither is there occaſion miniſtred</hi>

But no God he is, if that Holy Thing that was born of <hi>Mary</hi> was not God; and if that Holy Thing that was born of <hi>Mary</hi> was not God, then there is no God: For, <hi>the Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. 110. 1. And <hi>there be that are called gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many) but unto us there is but one God, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. And <hi>all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. And, <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3. 8. And, <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs; God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. And if he were not the Son of God, then is your Faith vain, and ye are yet in your ſins; For, <hi>He became the Author of Eternal Salvation to as many as obey him, yea, even to as many as believe in his Name,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. And if he be not God, how can his Name be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in? for the Name of God is Power; and how can that which hath not power be the Author of Eternal Salvation? and what obedience due where there is no power?

Wherefore, when as <hi>Oreſtes</hi> had nailed on the Theatre the Writ of Politick Government, for ſo they called the Lieutenants Proclamation, ſome of <hi>Cyrillus</hi>'s familiar Friends ſtepped up, and among the reſt one <hi>Hierax,</hi> to examine what the Lieutenant had written; whom when the Jews had eſpied there, they exclaimed that he came thither for no other cauſe but to ſet the people together by the Ears. <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> although he envied the Biſhops, becauſe they had cut ſhort the credit and power of the Magiſtrates, which was done by reaſon of them with the Emperors, yet then he ſpighted <hi>Cyrillus</hi> above all other times, becauſe of his prying into the Lieutenants Writings, and curiouſly ſifting out the Contents and meanings of them; therefore he cauſed <hi>Hierax</hi> openly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <note place="margin">

Thus ſaith the Hiſtory, a ridiculous kind of Superſtition, by placing himſelf in a Pillar high from the Earth, and ſcarce two Cubits wide; to think that this brought him nigher to the Angels, and to accompliſh that which thereof hath been quoted by the Hiſtory; and all this, as I have intimated, ſprings from the ignorance of the Principle of God in man, by, and in which, and as that revealeth him, man only can know God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Epidamus,</hi> of late <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> was alſo, whilſt <hi>Juſtinus</hi> was yet alive, ſore ſhaken with an Earthquake, ſo was <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Anazarbus</hi> a head City in <hi>Cilicia</hi> the leſs, which now the fourth time endured that calamity, whom <hi>Juſtinus</hi> repaired with great ſums of mony. <hi>Edeſſa</hi> was alſo overflown with the ſtreams of the River <hi>Scirius,</hi> which ſlided by in ſuch a manner, that many houſes were carried away with the violence of the ſtream, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people drowned. <hi>Edeſſa</hi> and <hi>Anazarbus</hi> had new names given them by <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> who called either of them <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolis.</hi>

            <p>And in the cloſe of all, <hi>Juſtinus</hi> came to end his race, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> his Siſters Son fellow Emperor, and reigned together with him about four months, and in the whole eight years nine months and three dayes, he died.</p>
            <p>Now come new troubles on again, by reaſon of that which ſtill diſquieted the State and the Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> the impoſing of Religion; <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> was Emperor alone, and the Faith of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was ordered to be preached alone, which <note place="margin">The Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi> Faith ordered to be preached alone.

            <p>
               <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> was a great favourer (as I have ſaid) of the <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cap. 10: So doth <hi>Theodora</hi> the Empreſs.</note> Council, and his Wife <hi>Theodora</hi> held with the contrary, <hi>viz. thoſe that held that in Chriſt was one Nature:</hi> Whether out of deſign, that between them both, both Opinions might have countenance; or whether they were really in oppoſition.

            <p>Things relating to Religion being thus diſtributed, the World was ſet upon a jangle; <hi>Anthimus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> muſt out, and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> muſt ſucceed; and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> muſt give way to <hi>Zoilus;</hi> and the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council muſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be preached throughout the whole World, and none muſt be ſo bold as to accurſe it; and if any were found to be of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, they muſt by all means be endeavoured to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. For <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> publiſhed an Edict, wherein he accurſed both <hi>Severus,</hi> and as many as held with him, and enjoyned great penalties on ſuch as maintained their Opinion; to this end, (as he thought) but it proved quite otherwiſe, as it hath in all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience throughout the World been found in impoſing Religion; that from that time forth there might no diſſention take root in any of all the Churches throughout the World, but that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of every Province might hold together, and the Biſhops of every City obey their Arch-Biſhops; and that the four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, the firſt at <hi>Nice,</hi> the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the firſt held at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſhould be preached in the Churches.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SWearing,</hi> as National Worſhip had its inſtitution under the Jews, where their Worſhip and Service being outward, that which was the Bond or Obligation thereunto, was alſo of the ſame nature; So the Jew was required to ſwear, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth, in Truth, in Righteouſneſs, and Judgment;</hi> and ſo among men an Oath was an end of all ſtrife. And many of the holy men of God ſware, who were before the Law, who notwithſtanding were in the ſtate unto which the Law was afterwards adminiſtred. As <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who built Altars, (were in outward Adminiſtrations) and worſhipped the Lord; and ſo were <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> after the Tranſgreſſion, they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord the firſt Fruits of the Ground, and their Cattel; for tranſgreſſion having entered, and man by reaſon of tranſgreſſion being from that in which he was made, thitherto he was brought again, or the communication of the knowledge of God, was by things which were outward, and their ſervice unto him, though yet they were not without the thing that was inward, which gave them the ſence of the Lord, and from which the outward many times proceeded.</p>
            <p>So the Jews had the inward, and there was an eye that ſaw through all that which was outwardly adminiſtred, the <hi>Seed, which is Chriſt;</hi> but the ſight and ſence of this was little and weak, by reaſon of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which had entered, which had blinded the eye, which to open, and to bring to the ſight of that which was before the tranſgreſſion was, the Law was added, or the outward adminiſtration, which being earthly, and like to that into which man was drove after he had ſinned, by things that were earthly and outward, man was brought by little and little to the ſight of the inward, which was vailed over. And ſo the Law came to be added, or the outward adminiſtration, or that which ſtood in the earthly, to anſwer to the ſtate of man which was in the earth, that ſo in or by an adminiſtration of that which was earthy, ſuitable to the earthy
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100654:105"/> eſtate, in which he was; the underſtanding or ſight of the other thing might be brought through, and the Vail might be done away.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things held (as I ſaid before to the firſt particular of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Worſhip) but till the time of Reformation, till that time came, which being in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fleſh, the nature that had ſinned and tranſgreſſed, over which darkneſs was come, which took upon it the nature, and was made fleſh, broke through the outward Adminiſtration, and the Nature which was ſuitable to it, and from within, rent the Vail, which was the fleſh, or the earthy, into which man was drove (as I ſaid) when he had tranſgreſſed, and tore it in pieces, the Partitian Wall, that which ſeparated, and of <hi>twain made one new man, which is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as in the Nature which is fleſhly, and of the Earth, the Seed, which is Chriſt, in which man was made, being covered over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb'd, ſo that man had little or no underſtanding of that in which he was made, to lead and guide him, but as that Nature was helped by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration which was ſuitable unto it; ſo he coming in the <hi>likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemning ſin in the fleſh,</hi> broke through in the Nature, Death, and Hell, and the Grave, and the powers of the Prince of Darkneſs, which lodged in the Nature, and there had its hold by reaſon of tranſgreſſion, over that as to the particular of every man, in which man was made and brought to light, to the underſtanding of man, the manifold wiſdom of God, that which had been hid from Ages and Generations paſt, which had been covered over, and buried, and laid in the earth, and the earthy over it, as aforeſaid. And ſo ceaſed the thing of an outward adminiſtration, as he, the Seed, which is Chriſt, coming into the Nature unto which the outward was, which was of the ſame Nature, which kept the Seed under, in which lodged the enemy, who entered by reaſon of tranſgreſſion, to keep it from riſing, as in the particular of this, and that man, and as to any thing that came from without, to get entrance through this Bar, to that which lay under, by reaſon of which man might come to ſee where he is; I ſay, ceaſed the thing of an outward Adminiſtration, as he coming into the Nature, paſſed through and rent it to pieces, that is to ſay, the Nature in which ſtood the Bar, and the Adminiſtration, which was to the Nature in which the Bar ſtood.</p>
            <p>So that which at firſt, which by reaſon of tranſgreſſion came to be put under, being brought through again, the underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man to lead and guide, that which was a help to man in the ſtate in which he ſtood, came to be removed, as was the Nature in the particular of him, who <hi>took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and by one offering for ever perfected thoſe that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now thoſe things being come to an end, as he (as aforeſaid) came through all, and <hi>brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel,</hi> which is the power of <hi>God to ſalvation;</hi> no ſtreſs is to be put upon things of that nature, nor may they be required, but he the Reformer is to be heard in all things, the <hi>Law wrote in the heart, the fear put in the inward part,</hi> who hath put an end unto them all, the way is open unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Through him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we have all acceſs unto the Father through one Spirit.</hi> And <hi>there is neither</hi> Jew <hi>nor</hi> Gentile, Barbarian, <hi>or</hi>

He paſſed through them whom the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought oftentimes to kill, whoſe Kingdom was not of this World, who had no outward Arm to preſerve and keep him; his Apoſtles and Diſciples, who had no Arm of fleſh, and whoſe Doctrine had no tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or defence by the Sword of man, whom the powers of the Earth were againſt, carried through their Doctrine throughout, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all oppoſition; and though they were eſteemed as perverters, changing the Laws and Cuſtoms, and turning the World upſide down, <note place="margin">

            <p>So that the Teſtimony is abundant to this thing of which I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even the whole Series of that which hath born through and ſuffered for the Truth from the beginning; and that the Truth yet is from the beginning, notwithſtanding all that in this World hath made head againſt it; which hath ſeemed alwayes (in compariſon) to be little in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100654:108"/> World, and which the men of the World, and the Prince of it, hath ſought to pull down, but hath not been able; Naked Truth which is greater than all, by its own force and virtue, which is ſpiritual, hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and given all to do the ſame, who have been led and guided by it; that which ſubdues the ſpirits of men, that which chains, that binds the ſtrong man armed, and makes the Devils ſubject, can certainly prevail to keep all that are guided by it, in whom it lives, and by whom they are preſerved and kept. <hi>The Lord, the everlaſting God, neither fainteth, nor is weary, there is no ſearching out of his underſtanding. The Power of God, Chriſt Jeſus, by whom all things were made and preſerved,</hi> without which (ſaid he to <hi>Pilate)</hi> nothing could be done unto him, without doubt is able, and will (as he ſees its moſt advantage to his Truth, and the glory of his Name) keep thoſe in whom it lives, who know the Rock that is higher than they, the ſtrong Tower, the Name of the Lord, to which the <hi>Righteous fly and are ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to anſwer the Objection which happily may ariſe in ſome in point of ſafety, ſhould that be inſiſted on which looks to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Arms; the Truth had never been at this day, had not the virtue and power thereof preſerved and kept it ſelf, and all who have kept to it: Wars and the Sword were not in the beginning, in the <hi>beginning it was not ſo;</hi> man was made in that, or by it which made the Creation; there was no variance; <hi>Adam</hi> gave names to all the Creation; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures came to <hi>Noah</hi> by an inſtinct, not humane, to be preſerved in the Ark. The firſt uſe of Arms was found in <hi>Cain,</hi> who killed his Brother becauſe of Religion; the enmity entered with tranſgreſſion, the ſtrange Nature, which knew not that in which all things were made, which ſought the deſtruction of that which was made; that which is come to redeem from tranſgreſſion, redeems from the conſequence, or that which followed by reaſon of tranſgreſſion as well as tranſgreſſion; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the enmity, caſts it out, which having entered into the Creation, ſeeks to deſtroy it, which is the Devil, and brings where man was in the beginning, where one Spirit, that by which all things were made, which is tender to that it hath made, which is the Harmony or Union, where no Jar is, lives and rules; and hitherto things muſt all come again; And as that in and by which all things were made comes to live, as it comes to live, works to this out of the contrary; and that which will be in the end muſt be in the beginning, and a beginning it muſt have, and ſome muſt begin it, and who ſhould, or can do this, but thoſe in whom this is ſo come to live, that in the particular hath ſo far overcome, that this it can do, which is to be an example, or a leader to the reſt, till iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being overcome, and that which deſtroyes the Creation being caſt out, the Earth enjoy her Sabbaths again, and the oppreſſor ceaſeth out of the Land; <hi>Happy is that people who are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 15. in a thing of another nature) <hi>Yea, happy are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>He gave his back to the ſmiter, and his cheeks to them that plucketh off the hair, and hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting,</hi> Iſa. 50. 6.

            <p>So let all men be ſatisfied in this thing, the Doctrine that I preach is not new, it was in the beginning, and is in meaſure in ſome again, and will be in the end. The Prophets have propheſied ſo, the Lord of Life in his humiliation witneſſed it to be ſo, ſo did the Prophets and Apoſtles, ſo have all his Witneſſes to this day, and ſo now it is witneſſed, and will be till all hath an end, and till time is no more. The Witneſſes of Jeſus, though men of War, otherwiſe, laid down to this. The <hi>Roman</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Souldiers, when it came to this, laid down their Sword-Girdles, as aforeſaid, and imbraced death as Chriſtians; <hi>I am a Chriſtian,</hi> and ſo ſuffered; ſo have the Chriſtians in ſucceeding Ages. Why ſhould I fill the World with reports of what Hiſtories have ſaid of this matter any further? The ground hath been ſhewn wherein War ſtands, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ground of the alteration, and wherein that ſtands which gives it.

            <head>THE Fourth General Head Concerning the Changeable Prieſthood.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth and laſt Head is, the</hi> Changeable Prieſthood, <hi>the Riſe and Original of that, and of the contrary, to which I ſhall ſpeak, and then I ſhall end as to theſe Heads or Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>Changeable Priſthood</hi> had its Date with the Nation of the Jews, it was Figurative, and ended in him who changed the Prieſthood, who is a <hi>Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck, <hi>without beginning of dayes, or end of life,</hi> whom the Changeable Prieſthood ſignified; <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the Holy Places made with hands, which are the figures of the True, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us: Nor yet that he ſhould offer up himſelf often, as the high Prieſt entred into the holy Place every year with blood of others; for then muſt be often have ſuffered ſince the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; but now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf: And as it is appointed for men once to die, but after this the Judgment; So Chriſt was offered once to bear the ſins of many, and to them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without ſin unto Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>So the Changeable Prieſthood had an end in him who changeth not, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever;</hi> And his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Miniſters of that of which he was, of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter but of the Spirit; not of that which changeth, but of that which changeth not; for the Letter (that which changed) killeth, but the Spirit (that which changeth not) giveth life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. And who (ſaith the Apoſtle) is ſufficient for theſe things? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>The changeable Prieſthood was then of the Law, which could not make the <hi>comers thereunto perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, which hope is Chriſt, Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory, the Myſtery hid from Ages and Generations, now made manifeſt to his Saints,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the Love of God is ſpread abroad in our hearts;</hi> which was a ſtedfaſt and ſtable thing, which was not ſubject to change, neither was it to paſs away. <hi>So</hi> Paul <hi>an Apoſtle, not of man, nor by man, but by the Will of God.</hi> And <hi>when it pleaſed God, who ſeparated me from</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:100654:110"/> 
               <hi>my Mothers Womb, and called me by his Grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately; I conſulted not with fleſh and blood, neither went I up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to them who were Apoſtles before me; But I went into</hi> Arabia, <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. And here ſtood their bottom, in Chriſt that changeth not, whoſe Miniſter he was; he preached his Miniſtry that changed not; his Miniſtry did not change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he of whom he preached, and who ſent him to preach, did not change; he was not in mans will which made and unmade at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor was he a Miniſter of Man, to preach what man pleaſed, or Conformity he received not by Tradition, or by certain concluſions or Syſtems of Divinity, or Art what to ſay; but the Son of God being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in him, he conſulted not with fleſh and blood, neither with the other Apoſtles that were before him, but preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus ſtood the ſtate of <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles, who had the mind of Chriſt; but the Form and the Letter which was done away, from that he preached not, in the oldneſs of the Letter, but in the newneſs of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now the Form and the Letter being done away, there was no room for that which was the Miniſtry of the Form, or the Letter, no more killing of Sheep, and ſlaying of Oxen; no more Sacrifices, Waſhings, New Moons, Sabbaths, Shadows of good things to come, who were the Shadows, but not the very things themſelves, which changed into the thing come, or had an end in it; no ground or footing at all for that, but as he who is everlaſting was come, the ſame for ever, ſo the Miniſtry muſt be of and from him; he muſt ſend, he muſt be revealed, the words muſt be ſpoken from his mouth, not the Letter but the Spirit; not the oldneſs of the Letter, but the newneſs of the Spirit: Thus ſtood it in the dayes of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>So the Miniſtry or Prieſthood that changeth, hath no ground from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but is quite otherwiſe, it is a changing or devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, it hath no footing either in the Letter or in the Spirit; not in the Letter, for that was a Prieſthood Figurative, having relation to him that was to come, which in him ended; ſo there was to be no more, as there never was but that: not in the Spirit, for that is it which changeth not, is not at the will, order, or direction of man, but the Will of God; its ground, its bottom, its fountain, its beginning and end is from him who changeth not, whom the changeable ſignified.</p>
            <p>I need not be long in theſe things, the matter being ſo plain already; the whole progreſs of the Hiſtory, which I have before been particular in, ſpeaks the Prieſthood after the Apoſtles deceaſe to be changeable, leaning to this Creed, and that confeſſion of Faith, and varying and changing, according to the leaders of that Confeſſion, and this Creed; and what work it made in the World, I have manifeſted, whatſoever ſtands not in him which changeth not, that is called Miniſtry, which is not Spirit, and proceeds from it; is not from him who is the Head of the Church, the Law-giver and Teacher of his People; it hath no footing from the Scriptures of Truth, nor the Spirit of them; it is ſo far from the Spirit, that in that ſence it is not Letter; it hath no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of the Jews, the Prieſthood, which was changed, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, nor to Chriſt Jeſus, or the Miniſtry of him, who changed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100654:110"/> the Prieſthood,<hi>—Jeſus I know, and</hi> Paul <hi>I know, but who are ye?</hi> ſaid the evil Spirit which was in the man, whom the Exorciſt Jews took upon them to adjure by Jeſus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached; from whence cometh <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 13, 14, 15.</note> this new covered Prieſthood which filleth the earth (may a man ſay) that is neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Jeſus,</hi> nor <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> it's much that men are not aſhamed of theſe things; Man makes man, men make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; diverſities of men make diverſities; here's the Prieſthood, a God they make, a Syſtem of Divinity, a Form of Worſhip, and then they form themſelves, or one another, Miniſters of that form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Teachers of the Syſtems or Precepts of Religion, they made of the God whom they formed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other God but me,</hi> ſaid the Lord to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, who gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> a form whereby to worſhip God; but now men make Godds, and make forms of Worſhip for their Godds, and Prieſts to their forms, and whoſoever will conſecrateth himſelf a Prieſt, or is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to whatſoever Godd he hath made, or Worſhip he hath formed, which is not from that which is everlaſting, the Prieſt that is for ever that changeth not; <hi>Whoſoever would, he conſecrated him, and he became one of the Prieſts of the high places,</hi> it is ſaid of, &amp; in the dayes of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 33. <hi>And the man</hi> Micah <hi>had an houſe of gods, and made an Ephod and Teraphim, and conſecrated one of his Sons, who became his Prieſt: In thoſe dayes there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>So the matter is plain, the ground, original, or riſe of all the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Miniſtry that is not Spirit, that is not in and from that which changeth not, the Miniſters of Chriſt, in whom is no variableneſs or ſhadow of changing, is neither from Chriſt nor the Scriptures, and hath neither ground nor foundation to be believed in, or heard, whoſe riſe is not in the Letter of the Scriptures, nor the Spirit, whoſe bottom is man, and the will of man, or rather the Devil in man, who cheats him into Worſhip, to make it, and then to bow down thereunto: And ſuch is all that which changeth, which is in the will of man, that is up and down as man will, that is political, which ſerves times and ſeaſons, and which changeth with them; its not the Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt, but its riſe is in that which is oppoſite unto him, the will, and wiſdom, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man, which is convertible, and changeth, which knows not God, <hi>which he came to confound, which he came to bring to nought, to whom every knee muſt bow, and tongue confeſs, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I have finiſhed this particular, I ſhall only now lay down cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſayings of the Antients, which relate unto our Principle, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo of men of latter dayes, or this preſent Generation, out of their own Writings, which conform thereunto; that ſo through all I may yet further ſhew that Truth, or that which the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> profeſs, is neither an upſtart thing, nor that which neither Scripture or Hiſtory, or the men of this Generation know, or before this day have heard of, but hath a more antient Date, even from the beginning; and is found not only before he came in the fleſh, who came to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereunto, (as I have declared) but ſince his dayes and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, even along the Apoſtacy, unto, and in this day, to the intent that a calm and quiet conſideration of theſe things may render Truth the leſs

            <p>Now, what is the Antient Faith of Mankind, &amp; the natural Belief which is planted in all reaſonable Souls, which to eradicate, is to overthrow the ſtrong and everlaſting Foundation of Virtue; but the Faith of God's Elect, the Nature by which the Gentiles, <hi>not having the Law, did the things contained in the Law, and ſo were a Law unto themſelves:</hi> The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Chriſt Jeſus being the Corner-Stone; The <hi>Law wrote in the heart, the Fear put in the inward parts;</hi> The Principle of God: for no other than the Principle of God can be of Virtue, the ſtrong and everlaſting Foundation; the natural Belief which is planted in all reaſonable Souls, that there is a God, can be no other than the Principle, or that which flows from the Principle of God, which is planted in all reaſonable Souls: So all have it, or it is not in all; for Nature that is in the Fall cannot give to underſtand God, or be a foundation of Faith in him, but intitles to wrath, as the Apoſtle ſaid,<hi>—By Nature Children of Wrath.—</hi>So then the natural belief planted in all reaſonable Souls, muſt be another nature than that which intitles to wrath, or naturally genders to it; for in that the Faith is not ſet, that there is a god which knows not God, for <hi>he that ſinneth hath neither ſeen him nor known him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; but it muſt needs be the Nature in which all things were made, which is of God, in which the Faith of God ſtands, the Faith of Gods Elect, the Faith once delivered to the Saints, the common Salvation, which whoſoever oppoſes, oppoſes the Faith of Gods Elect, the Faith once delivered to the Saints, the common Faith which is planted in every one, in all rational Souls, or which gives them to know there is a God, and to believe in him, which may be called <hi>Salvation;</hi> foraſmuch as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By Faith ye are ſaved;</hi> which they who oppoſe this Principle, without which God cannot be known, much leſs be believed in, do affront, and that inſolently the common Faith which is in every man, or the Principle of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, and what he underſtands thereby.

            <p>I may now proceed to another, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Doctor <hi>John Owen,</hi> ſometimes Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who taking upon him to write againſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> thus wrote for them and their Principles.</p>
            <p>Concerning the interpreting of the Scriptures, he layeth it down as an indubitable Truth, and which hath been proved to be ſuch by the reformed Divines (as they are called) the things following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the only publick, authentick, and infallible Interpreter of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Exerc.</hi> 2, 9, 7. againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Holy Scripture, is he who is the Author of them, from the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whoſe Spirit it derives all its Verity, Perſpicuity, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This Author and Interpreter of the Scriptures, is the Spirit, partly ſpeaking in the Scripture, and ſetting down its mind therein;</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:100654:112"/> 
               <hi>and if there be any doubtful and obſcure paſſages therein, explaining himſelf by that Analogy or Harmony of the whole Doctrine which is found therein, and partly infuſing a ſpiritual [Light] into our hearts, whereby we may be led into the knowledge of all neceſſary Truths revealed in the Word.—And therefore, as there never was any [viſible] Judge of Faith</hi> (then man, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> as man, hath nothing to do in it; and ſo what is become of all the inſtitutions and inforcings of men, or their medling with Religion? and the impoſings, which the Doctor himſelf wrought the Council of the late Army to, in their Addreſs to the then called <hi>Long</hi> (yet ending) <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which undid the Army, and wrought them againſt their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Engagements) <hi>appointed by Chriſt; So neither is there any uſe or need of ſuch an Arbitrator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, he ſaith, <hi>That every Chriſtian hath it as a duty incumbent upon him to inquire into the mind of God in the Scriptures,</hi> (and no man knows the things of God but the Spirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit ſhall reveal them; <hi>but we have the mind of Chriſt;</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be <hi>within the Hope of Glory,</hi> for where the mind of Chriſt is, there is Chriſt) <hi>that is, to ſeek into the meaning of them (and that muſt be by the Spirit,</hi> as are his own words, as aforeſaid) <hi>by all requiſite means</hi> (and himſelf ſaith there is no other but the Spirit, the only publick, authentick, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpreter, as aforeſaid) <hi>and to expound them to himſelf</hi> (which muſt be by knowing his Teacher within) <hi>for his own edification, for the juſt ſhall live</hi> (ſo every man muſt have it in his own particular) <hi>by his Faith.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus as to the Interpretation of the Scriptures. Now as to Teaching, and the teaching of others, or Preaching.</p>
            <p>Sect. 14. <hi>In that community</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>between God and man, through a Relation, which a reaſonable creature cannot but have to a good Creator, from whence ariſes this indiſpenſible neceſſity to worſhip and obey him; it is requiſite that all ſhould know him, and what is his will,</hi> (and how can they do that, unleſs they know the Principle of him, where only his Will is to be known?) <hi>according to the decree of means conducing thereunto,</hi> (and this can only be the Spirit, as his own words hath expreſſed it, as hath been rehearſed) <hi>which is graciouſly afforded them.</hi> (which muſt by the Doctors own words, be the manifeſtation of the Spirit given to every one to profit withal, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and which he himſelf in the next words further expreſſes what it is) <hi>This is the great Dictate of Nature</hi> (which cannot be that which is in the tranſgreſſion, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) <hi>and Preſcript of the Law.</hi> (and what Law that is, in the very next words he expreſſes) <hi>This Duty is no leſs imprinted in the heart of man, than in the Decalogue,</hi> (So it's the Law written in the heart, and the fear put into the inward parts, which till it was come, <hi>viz.</hi> the new Covenant, the Seed, which is Chriſt, the Law or Decalogue was added, or the outward adminiſtration, which the other ſhould do when it was come, which was within, but not ſeen or felt, but put under, or as it were dead, buried, and ſo lying, the Seed, which is Chriſt, as hath been ſaid) <hi>amongſt the means which God makes uſe of for the diſcovery of himſelf, the Holy Scripture</hi> (this muſt be underſtood by his own expreſſions by the Spirit, as aforeſaid) <hi>is not onely the moſt excellent of all others; but as to ſaving Truths, it is the ſole and only manifeſter thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100654:113"/>
            <p>Thus as to the firſt part, that is, <hi>That all ſhould know God, and do his Will,</hi> the great Dictate of Nature, and Preſcript of the Law; And this great Dictate of Nature, and Preſcript of the Law, muſt needs be the meaſure of God, by which only God can be known, and his Will done, which all muſt have, or how elſe can it be natural, for Nature is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive word, or that in which all that are of that ſtock and kind are intituled or inveſted; or it cannot be Nature, or a Law to be obſerved by all, or preſcribed, if all have it not; And ſo it is our, or the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (viz.) the meaſure of God in all, whereby, and in which he is to be known, and who is the Teacher of his People. Now as to the other which is <hi>Preaching,</hi> or teaching of others.<hi>—As the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God</hi> (and what knowledge that is, and how it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already out of his own words, and unavoidable concluſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, which I muſt deſire the Reader to carry along with him, that he may bear the ſence, for there is ſomething in this matter) <hi>attended with the Spiritual ſubjection of the Soul; unto him intirely is the principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in the firſt Table;</hi> (which is the Principle of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as aforeſaid, as his own words hath concluded it) <hi>So in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the main thing enjoyned, is the love of our Neighbour: Now to love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to wiſh and to will unto him all theſe things which we think good for him, and as far as lies in our power to procure them for him;</hi> (yet this is not to love ones Neighbour as ones ſelf, by the Doctors leave, as they uſe to ſay, but as a man thinks it's good for his Neighbour; So this is a wrong interpretation to the Commandment, and ſo a taking away from thence, and it is too narrow, and hath a reſtriction) <hi>And the more perfect diſcoveries of things that a lover hath, the more perfect and excellent is the good that he wiſhes, and cannot but wiſh unto him whom he loves. Now ſince that love muſt be of a very tranſcendent degree, and proportioned to that wherewith we love our ſelves, it cannot be ſuch, unleſs we deſire to communicate and impart unto our beloved, (as far as in us lies) that which is the principal of all Goods; and ſince the knowledge of God, is life eternal, and conſequently the chiefeſt good one can wiſh unto another;</hi> (and what that knowledge of God is, and wherein it conſiſts, and where it lies, hath already been obſerved from his own words, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Dictate of Nature, the Preſcript of the Law, no leſs imprinted in the heart of man, than in the Decalogue, <hi>viz.</hi> the meaſure of God in every man, which gives to know God, and wherein onely he is to be known, the knowledge of whom is eternal life) <hi>It follows from the Dictates of this commanding and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Love, that it is not Arbitrary for any to will or refuſe to inſtruct another in this ſaving Knowledge,</hi> (viz. the meaſure of God, the great Dictate of Nature, the Preſcript aforeſaid to teach from this) <hi>if he be able ſo to do, but all are indiſpenſibly obliged to this performance of their duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Doctor hath <hi>in terminis,</hi> or ſo many words, held forth the very ſame thing, and no other than what the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, as their Principle, viz. <hi>that [all] ſhould know God, and what is his Will.</hi> That this is the great Dictate of Nature, and Preſcript of the Law; that this duty is no leſs imprinted in the heart of man, than in the Decalogue, that this Knowledge is ſaving, and to inſtruct one another in this ſaving knowledge, all that are able, that is to ſay, ſuch as have received a gift in whom the thing moves to ſpeak, which gives the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

(2.) Or when others urge us to do
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100654:119"/> that which in it ſelf good, or may lawfully be done, but through error of Conſcience we judge it to be evil and unlawful; if in this caſe, we do not that which is preſt upon us, we ſin, becauſe the thing is good and lawful: And if we do it, we ſin, becauſe we do againſt our Conſciences, which in this caſe bindeth, but obligeth not: And yet there is a way to eſcape out of this Laborynth, it being repugnant to the equity of the Will of God, to lay a neceſſity of ſinning upon any man; the only way is, to lay aſide ſuch a Conſcience, it being a part of the old Man, which we are commanded to put off; otherwiſe we being ſufficiently informed, and yet cleaving to our old error, we rather do violence to our Conſcience our ſelves, than ſuffer violence from others.</q>

A preſumption</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>too high for any mortal, ſince every true Chriſtian is able to give a reaſon of his Faith, hath the Word of God before him, the promiſed Holy Spirit, and the mind of Chriſt within him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 16. <hi>A much better and ſafer guide of Conſcience,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which as far as concerns himſelf, he may far more certainly know then any outward rule inpoſed on him by others, whom he inwardly either knows not, nor can know; at leaſt knows nothing of them more ſure than this one thing, That they cannot be his Judges in Religion,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 15. <hi>The Spiritual man judges all things, but he himſelf is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no man; chiefly for this cauſe do all true</hi> Proteſtants <hi>account the Pope Antichriſt, for that he aſſumes to himſelf this infallibility over both the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the Scripture, ſitting in the Temple of God, as it were oppoſite to God, and exalting himſelf over all that is called God, or is worſhipped,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 4. <hi>That is to ſay, not onely above all Judges and Magiſtrates, who though they be called Godds, are far beneath infallible, but alſo above God himſelf, by giving Law both to the Scripture, to the Conſcience, and to the Spirit it ſelf of God within us; when as we find,</hi> James 4. 12. There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy: who art thou that judgeſt another? <hi>That Chriſt is the only Law-giver of his Church, and that it is here meant in Religious matters, no well-grounded Chriſtian will deny. Thus alſo St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. Who art thou that judgeſt the Servant of another? to his own Lord he ſtandeth or falleth; but he ſhall ſtand, for God is able to make him ſtand. <hi>As therefore of one beyond expreſſion bold and preſumptuous, both theſe Apoſtles demand, Who art thou that preſumeſt to impoſe [other] Law or Judgment in Religion than the only Law-giver and Judge Jeſus Chriſt, who can only ſave, and can deſtroy, gives to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And the forecited place to the</hi> Theſſalonians, <hi>by compared effects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves us, That be he or they, who or where-ever they be, or can be, they are of far leſs Authority than the Church, whom in theſe things, as</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>they receive not; and yet no leſs Antichriſt in this main point of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm; no leſs Pope or Popedom than he at Rome, if not much more, by ſetting up Supream Interpreters of Scripture, either thoſe Doctors whom they follow, or which is far worſe themſelves, as a Civil Papacy, aſſuming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Supremacy to themſelves, not in Civil only, but Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes. Seeing then that in matters of Religion, as hath been proved, none can judge or determine here on earth, no not Church-Governors themſelves, againſt the Conſciences of other Believers; my inference is, or rather not mine but our Saviour's own, that in thoſe caſes they neither can command, nor uſe reſtraint, leſt they run raſhly on a pernitious conſequence forwarned in that Parable,</hi> Mat. 13. 26, to 31. Leſt while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up alſo the Wheat with them, let both grow together until the Harveſt;

               <q rend="inline">Of this I think my ſelf <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the more aſſured, becauſe no beginning of time can be aſſigned when the World entertained this belief, but that the common Parent of mankind, who was made with it, and to whom it was confirmed by converſation with God, taught it his Children, who eaſily received it, becauſe when they arrived to that Age, in which they were capable of being taught by others; they plainly perceived that it did naturally ſpring from the free exerciſe of their own underſtandings.
